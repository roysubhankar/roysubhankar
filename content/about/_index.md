## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the *Multimedia Team* of **Telecom Paris**. The primary focus of my research is to equip deep learning models with better generalization capabilities under *data distribution* and *semantic* shifts. In particular, my main research areas include **domain adaptation**, **continual learning**, **novel class discovery**, and so on.

I received my Ph.D. degree in 2022 with *cum-laude* from the University of Trento, where I was advised by Prof. Elisa Ricci and [Prof. Nicu Sebe](https://disi.unitn.it/~sebe/). During my Ph.D. I spent six wonderful months as an intern in **Naver Labs Europe**, where I had the pleasure to work with [Gabriela Csurka](https://europe.naverlabs.com/people_user/Gabriela-Csurka/) and other brilliant colleagues. I was also fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Arno Solin](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/) from Aalto University, with whom I worked on bayesian neural networks.  Prior to the doctoral degree, in 2018 I received the M.Sc. degree in Telecommunication engineering from the University of Trento with the maximum marks. During my masters I worked with [Prof. BegÃ¼m Demir](https://begumdemir.com/) on applying deep learning techniques to tackle remote sensing problems.
