tldr: It addresses unsupervised domain adaptation by using embedded full-whitening and coloring transformation blocks \(\text{F}^2\text{WCT}\). The proposed \(\text{F}^2\text{WCT}\) optimally aligns the feature distributions by ensuring that the source and target features have identical covariance matrices.
