tldr: In this work we exploit “web-supervision” from Large Language-Vision Models (LLVMs) to address Source-Free Video Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, driven by the rationale that LLVMs contain a rich world prior surprisingly robust to domainshift. Our parameter-efficient method, which we name Domain Adaptation with Large Language-Vision models (DALLV), distills the world prior and complementary source model information into a student network tailored for the target domain.
